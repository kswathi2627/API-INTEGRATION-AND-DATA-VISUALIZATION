#DESCRIPTION

The API Integration and Data Visualization project showcases how Python can be used to combine external real-time data sources with powerful visualization tools. In this project, data is fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API, which provides detailed weather forecasts. The program extracts key attributes such as temperature, humidity, and forecast times, and then processes them into a structured format for analysis.

Once the data is retrieved, the system leverages Matplotlib to create interactive and easy-to-understand graphs. These graphs display temperature and humidity variations across multiple time intervals, helping users quickly identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in weather conditions.

A robust error-handling mechanism is also included. In cases where the API key is missing, invalid, or there is no internet connection, the script automatically falls back to sample weather data. This ensures that the visualization component remains functional, making the project reliable for both learning purposes and real-world applications.

The project highlights how API-driven applications can enhance decision-making by converting raw JSON data into visual dashboards. With a few modifications, this same framework can be applied to stock prices, COVID-19 data, cryptocurrency trends, or social media analytics, making it highly flexible and extendable.

Deliverables:

A Python script that fetches and processes weather data.

Line charts for temperature and humidity variations over time.

A reusable framework for integrating other APIs and datasets.

A sample visualization dashboard that works with both live and fallback data.
